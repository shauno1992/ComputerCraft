Welcome all!

This repository is my collection of computer craft programs for the mod ComputerCraft for minecraft!

I'll keep you updated on the different programs I make and will attempt to update code regularly! 

These programs are all coded in Lua, which you can read more about here:http://www.lua.org/

If you have any questions or suggestions for my programs please feel free to comment! I welcome constructive criticism, and am open to all ideas or implementations suggested!

Lastly and most importantly this code is open source, so you can use it in any way that you wish. All I ask is that credit is given where credit is due!
